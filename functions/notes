consider a function that would spit out basic text results (max/min, what year they were observed, where)

consider a function for trend analysis. don;t need to do this for all parameters, just when there's exceedences or general interest in the topic

some regulatory limits require special consideration for how to plot. eg Cu has freshwater actute and chronic criteria that both depend on hardness

maybe a function calculate hardness?

try doing all this for Cu specifically and see what we can learn



seperate external script that calculates reg limits & hardness for all parameters, all sample events
