Following through on Cu as example parameter with non-static regulatory value; depends on hardness

steps:

1.) in external script, calculate hardness for all sample events where available, store csv

2.) modify boxplot script 
- try case_when - source for parameters where reg limits are calculated vs not
case_when(parameter = one_of(static_reg_vals, source("static_reg_vals.xlsx",
          parameter = one_of(dynamic_reg_vals,source)   )))
          

Still working here, not sure how to make dynamic calculations/references
