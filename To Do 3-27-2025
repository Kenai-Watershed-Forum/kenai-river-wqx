# Tasks with regards to flagging / flagged data and its presentation/archival


<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Actions:

0) move flag decisions to the end of appendix a, AFTER all flaggig decisions have been made (DONE)

1) delete 2021 data currently in wqp (DONE)

2) modify import template in CDX to accommodate a "flag" column, maybe another "result detection condition" (one for the lab results, one for the KWF QA)

--> Result Status ID = Rejected/Accepted
--> Result Status Qualifier = Lab qualifier if applicable

notes on import config
--current structure contains both of these

2.1) look at other/input/AQWMS/2021_data_flag_decisions.csv , and the options under "result measure qualifier". decide
if going to do more sophisticalted than flag Y/N. if not, us "FQC" (Quality Control - Failed; see report). Make
clear this designation is from KWF's QA/QC process and not just lab results; see other code names

3) re-import 2021 data with new template

4) download all kwf data again and re-integrate into report

5) modify table function so that flag column info is displayed










# 3/20/25
working through each chapter for custom fixes


# 3/6/25
Is 2021 data displaying when applicable?
Check for more obvious outliers.

why no static reg vals appearing in some cases? eg pH 


# 3/5/2025
Updated the source with corrected 2021 data from wqx, but boxplot figures still not displaying 2021 data in some cases. 
also, Ca, Mg, Fe 2021 data clearly have wrong units. need to fix and replace content in wqx
need to remove legend where not applicable also

# 2/25/25
Sent email to help desk at EPA for assistance on updating/deleting 2021 data. today, just workingon getting 
the update version prepped.

# 2/14/2025
working at line 340 in reg_limits. make sure 2021 hydrocarbon data format aligns with 2000 - 2013.
2021 epq wqx did not include hydrocarbons? diagnose in appendix a
--> appears that final export prep to epa cdx does include hydrocarbons. are they in the download???
--> diagnosis: hydrocarbons were in the upload to epa wqx in jan 2024, but are not present in the download in jan 2025
--> plan: delete all 2021 data from epa wqx, make corrections as outlined in gdoc, re-upload all 2021 data to epa cdx.
--> then, repeat ingestion process to this report
--> gdoc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p1fsh2dVfvIWNmRrpjteOTyLPSEeMYoQDRk5XhKTcNk/edit?tab=t.0


also: get rid of extraneous legend data where hardness does not apply




# 2/6/2025
working at line 123 in reg_limits.qmd.
here we discover that hardness values do not properly calculate with addition of 2021 data.
to do: 1) address calculation of hardness values; adress units/conversion for some summer 
2021 values that are out of realisic range


ex: summer 2021 no name creek dups, diss Ca = 16200 and 16300 ug/L, total Ca dups = 13.7 and 1.8 mg/L dups


# 2/3/2025
1) try a new fresh download from EPA WQX, ensure it has the 2021 data and it can be read in/integrated with the report document
2) proceed with years in this doc, going 2021 backwards

see to do list in data_sourcing.qmd doc

working in reg_limits.qmd, see hastags.
put new wqp downloads in kwf work cpu also
note: data_sourcing a mess at the moment
