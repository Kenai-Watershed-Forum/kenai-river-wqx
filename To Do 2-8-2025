working at line 123 in reg_limits.qmd.
here we discover that hardness values do not properly calculate with addition of 2021 data.
to do: 1) address calculation of hardness values; adress units/conversion for some summer 
2021 values that are out of realisic range


ex: summer 2021 no name creek dups, diss Ca = 16200 and 16300 ug/L, total Ca dups = 13.7 and 1.8 mg/L dups

1) try a new fresh download from EPA WQX, ensure it has the 2021 data and it can be read in/integrated with the report document
2) proceed with years in this doc, going 2021 backwards

see to do list in data_sourcing.qmd doc

working in reg_limits.qmd, see hastags.
put new wqp downloads in kwf work cpu also
note: data_sourcing a mess at the moment
