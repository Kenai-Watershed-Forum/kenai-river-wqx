    "text": "This report summarizes water quality data collected between summer 2000 and summer 2022 from 22 sampling locations in the Kenai River mainstem and its tributaries. Local, state, federal, and tribal government entities, as well as several local area non‐profits formed a cooperative partnership so that sampling teams from various agencies were able to collect water samples twice per year, once in the spring and once in the summer, and this effort continues beyond the publication of this report. The locations of the sampling sites are identified with maps, GPS coordinates, and photographs. Trends in the data are highlighted, and the results are compared to the Alaska and federal water quality standards for freshwater aquatic life.\nThe water quality data focuses on metals, nutrients, hydrocarbons, fecal coliform bacteria, and various field parameters. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc are the dissolved metals that have been analyzed, and calcium, iron, and magnesium were reported as total metals. Additionally, the report focuses on the nutrients nitrate and phosphorus. Specifically, the hydrocarbons that were collected and analyzed include diesel range organics, gasoline range organics, residual range organics, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene. Fecal coliform bacteria, pH, specific conductance, total suspended solids, turbidity, and water temperature are the remaining parameters that have been included in the analysis.\nThe results are displayed in graphs with associated written analyses and tables. The graphs display the median and variance for each parameter at a specific location, and these graphs are separated depending on whether the data was collected in the spring or in the summer. In some cases, parameters were present in levels that could not be detected by current laboratory analysis, and when this occurred with over 80% of the samples, scatter plots have been displayed omitting the unknown low levels.\n[previous reports published in 2007 and 2016]\n[Text from 2016 report: A trend analysis was conducted for the following parameters: Lead, Zinc and BTEX; based on the nature of the data, a polynomial line was used because it is the best way to capture and represent the fluctuations in the data.]\nComplete data tables can be found in Appendix XXX and XXX, which are organized by parameter and site location, respectively."

    "text": "We collected water samples at 13 locations along the Kenai River mainstem and from eight tributaries near their confluence points (see Figure 4.2). These locations were selected by a technical working group in 1997 to represent diverse regions through the Kenai River watershed’s ambient water quality conditions. Sampling occurred in the spring and the summer each year beginning in summer 2000.\nAfter a half‐day training session, staff from governmental and non‐governmental agencies dispersed between 7:00 AM - 9:00 AM to sampling locations in teams of two or more to collect samples. All samples were collected on the same day, and the timing of the sampling coincided with an outgoing tide, near low tide, to reduce the potential of collecting saline water from Cook Inlet (see Appendix X for timing). Typically, the individual collecting the sample waded into the water until the water level was around two feet deep, and the sample was collected while facing upstream. If the individual collected the sample using a boat, the samples were collected from the bow while the boat faced upstream. The bottles were placed approximately one foot below the surface to collect the water samples and then preserved for transportation to the laboratory. Beginning in spring 2002, two duplicate samples were collected for quality control. These procedures follow the protocols established in a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) that was originally approved by the ADEC in 2001 and later revised and approved by ADEC again in 2013, 2019, 2020. The QAPP was also reviewed and approved by the Region 10 Environmental Protection Agency office in 2023 [pending as of 2023-06-19]. The QAPP is available from Kenai Watershed Forum1 [pending as of 2023-06-19].\nWe used the R programming language in Posit software for all analyses, and generated this report using Quarto publishing software. The report is available both as a downloadable PDF and as an online report at [WEB ADDRESS].\nIn instances where data was reported as not detected the half of the MDL or MRL [ACRONYMS] was used to estimate the values and run the analysis. The MRL was used because during the early years of the project, the lab only provided this information and not the MDL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.kenaiwatershed.org/science-in-action/research-information/water-quality/↩︎"

    "text": "Download Arsenic Kenai River Baseline Data.csv\n\n\n\nFrom 2016 report:\nNatural sources of arsenic in the Cook Inlet Basin include volcanic ash, glaciation, and mineral deposits. Only a minimal contribution of arsenic results from human activities like wood preservation (Glass and Frenzel, 2001). Arsenic is naturally present as a compound in rocks within the Kenai River Watershed, and as a dissolved metal, it can be acutely or chronically toxic to fish (Glass, 1999). The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have set the standard at 150 micrograms per liter (µg/L) for freshwater aquatic life chronically exposed to arsenic and 10 micrograms per liter (µg/L) for drinking water (Appendix X) (USEPA, 2014; ADEC, 2008).\nNone of the samples exceeded the Alaska or federal standard for freshwater aquatic life at any sampling location in spring or summer. The highest level detected in the mainstem was 46.5 µg/L at Mile 1.5 in May 2007, and arsenic was not detected on many occasions below the method detection limit (MDL) of 0.25 µg/L (Table 6). In the Kenai River mainstem, Mile 1.5 had the highest median level in the spring event and summer monitoring event, followed by Mile 6.5 in the spring event and Mile 23 during the summer monitoring event (figures X & X). In the mainstem, higher arsenic levels occurred in the spring samples, while the tributaries levels were higher during the summer with more detected levels between the years 2007-2014 than any of the previous years. (Tables X & X)\nThe highest concentration on the mainstem occurred at Mile 1.5 where arsenic was detected on every sampling event after 2005, while arsenic was detected on all sampling dates at Beaver Creek, Soldotna Creek, and Moose River. The concentrations of arsenic ranged from a high of 12.8 µg/L in Soldotna Creek in summer 2014 to below the MDL of 0.25 µg/L in many locations. Of the tributaries, Soldotna Creek had the highest median level, followed by Moose River and then Beaver Creek in summer and Soldotna, Beaver and Moose in spring. No Name Creek had the fewest incidences of arsenic detection of all the tributaries. (Tables X & X)\nWhen comparing the arsenic levels to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation standards for drinking water, the main stem at Mile 1.5 is the only station that presents multiple exceedances. All exceedances took place during the spring sampling events. (Tables X & X)\nConcentrations of arsenic are generally lower in surface streams than in groundwater, which is typically the source of drinking water (Glass and Frenzel, 2001). The USEPA set the criterion for arsenic in drinking water at 10 µg/L because arsenic has been linked to cancer, skin damage, and circulatory problems (USEPA, 2003). Although the levels of arsenic reported in this study do not exceed the national criterion for the health of an aquatic community in freshwater, groundwater may contain concentrations that are hazardous to human health, and all sources of drinking water should be tested for arsenic."

    "text": "A.1 Introduction\nPrior to publishing analysis and interpretation of water quality data, we will ensure that all data that meets QA/QC standards outlined in the current project Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and is accessible in the appropriate repository.\nWater quality data from this project is ultimately destined for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Quality Exchange (EPA WQX). The process of transferring these data to the higher-level EPA repository is referred to as data “uplift.”\nThe Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for this project describes data management details and responsible parties for each step of the data pipeline from observation to repository. The 2021 data preparation and review process is published here as an appendix as an example of the process applied annually to each year’s data.\n\nA.1.1 2021 Water Quality Data\nIn this appendix we will collate 2021 laboratory data from several sources into a single spreadsheet document with a consistent format. The desired end format is a spreadsheet template provided by the EPA Water Quality Exchange. These template files are available to download from the EPA at https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-exchange-web-template-files.\nOnce the data is collated, it will be evaluated according to a Quality Assurance Checklist (template example provided by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Soldotna office). Field observations that do not meet the quality assurance standards described in the evaluation checklist will be flagged and will not be uplifted to the EPA WQX.\nData that has been uplifted to the EPA WQX is evaluated biannually by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in their Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report1. The integrated report evaluates available water quality data from the previous five years against Alaska water quality standards and regulations (ADEC 2020).\n\nA.1.1.1 2021 Water Quality Data AQWMS Formatting\nThe code scripts below assemble water quality data from the three analytical laboratories that partnered with Kenai Watershed Forum for this project in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories (Anchorage, AK)\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (Soldotna, AK)\nTaurianen Engineering and Testing (Soldotna, AK)\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.1 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results (SGS Labs)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n*Note: the chain of custody documents for SGS Laboratories are integrated into the above downloadable PDF files.\n\n\n\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.3.1\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.2 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP)/Taurianen Engineering)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results from SWWTP\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results from Taurianen\n\n\n\n\nDownload Spring 2021 Fecal Coliform Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\nDownload Summer 2021 Fecal Coliform Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.3 2021 Total Suspended Solids Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP))\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP.xlsx\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP.xlsx\n\n\n\n\nDownload Spring 2021 Total Suspended Solids Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\nDownload Summer 2021 Total Suspended Solids Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.2 2021 Provisional Results, Prior to Data Review\nResults last updated 2023-07-17\nThe above data sources have been collated in to a single .csv file (available for download) into a format compatible with the EPA Water Quality Exchange.

The draft Data Evaluation Checklist Template (available for download below) outlines these questions:\n\n\nDownload Draft Kenai Baseline Data Evaluation Checklist Template\n\n\n\nA.1.3.1 Pre-Database\n\n\nA.1.3.1.1 Overall Project Success\nNote: the sequence of questions is structured such that data will be gradually flagged at each step based on the criteria described.\n\n\n\n1.) Were the appropriate analytical methods used for all parameters?\nYes. Analytical methods from the approved 2020 QAPP were employed.\n\n2.) Were there any deviations from the sampling plan?\nAll sites were visited as planned on 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021. Most intrinsic water quality parameters measured with instruments (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity) were not measured.\n3.) Were field duplicates, blanks, and/or other QC samples collected as planned?\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Planned vs. Actual Analysis Results for 2021, Kenai Baseline\n\n\n\nTo see a table comparing planned vs actual results for 2021, view the csv file linked above.\nFrom the above table we can see that there are deviations between planned results and actual results available. These reasons for the deviations are known and are attributable to two causes:\nCause 1: The Spring 2021 Chain of Custody (COC) from KWF to SGS was completed erroneously. The COC specified for 200.8 analyses to be complete for all sites (when they should have stopped upstream of Morgan’s Landing RM31), and it also specified for 200.7 analyses to stop upstream of Morgan’s Landing (when they should have been performed for all sites in the project).\nAs a result, for Spring 2021 total metals data will be unavailable for sites upstream of the Morgan’s Landing RM31 site.\nCause 2: For Summer 2021, the SGS laboratory performed the 200.8 analyses for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes as requested. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free. In this case., there are no consequences of deviating from the planned analyses).\n\n4.) Do the laboratory reports provide results for all sites and parameters?\nThe laboratory reports provide results for all sites, and for all parameters, with the exceptions outlined above in question #3.\n\n5.) Is a copy of the Chain of Custody included with the laboratory reports?\nWe worked with three separate laboratories in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories, Anchorage, AK\n\nChain of Custody documents are included within the PDF laboratory reports linked above earlier in this appendix.\n\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant, Soldotna, AK\n\nChain of Custody documents are on file with Kenai Watershed Forum for fecal coliform and total suspended solids for 5/11/2021, and for total suspended solids on 7/27/2021.\n\nTauriainen Engineering & Testing, Soldotna, AK\n\nAn individual document for each sample reports the time and date of delivery and analysis for each sample. These documents are included with the PDF laboratory reports linked above earlier in this appendix.\n\n\n\n6.) Do the laboratory reports match the Chain of Custody and requested methods throughout?\nThe laboratory reports match the Chain of Custody and requested methods, with the one exception discussed in question #3. For summer 2021, the SGS laboratory performed the 200.8 analyses for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes as requested. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free. In this case., there are no consequences of deviating from the planned analyses).\n\n7.) Are the number of samples on the laboratory reports the same as on the Chain of Custody?\nThe quantity of sample bottles sent to the laboratories matches the number of analyzed samples for samples collected and delivered on 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021.\n\n8.) Was all supporting info provided in the laboratory report, such as reporting limits for all analyses and definitions?\nWe worked with three separate laboratories in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories, Anchorage, AK\n\nSGS provided data as PDFs which included reporting limits, as well as in the form of an Electronic Data Deliverable where this information is also included in column format.\n\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP), Soldotna, AK\n\nSWWTP provided data in the form of .xls files. Reporting limits are described in this project’s current Quality Assurance Action Plan.\n\nTauriainen Engineering & Testing, Soldotna, AK\n\nTauriainen provided data in the form of PDF documents. Reporting limits are described in this project’s current Quality Assurance Action Plan.\n\n\n\n9.) Are site names, dates, and times correct and as expected?\n\nYes, after post-season correction documented in this report. Notes: In 2021 Kenai Watershed Forum used pre-printed waterproof labels on all sample bottles, reducing opportunity for field and lab transcription errors. Remaining site name transcription errors from laboratories were corrected in post-season data review.\n\n\n10.) Were there any issues with instrument calibration?\n\nInstruments to measure intrinsic water quality parameters (sondes; to measure pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity) were not employed in 2021.\nTeams did use hand-held probes to record water temperature on-site. Prior to field use, the hand-held probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level defined in the QAPP using an ice bath in the Kenai Watershed Forum laboratory.\n\n\n11.) Did the instruments perform as expected?\n\nThe hand-held water temperature probes performed as expected in 2021.\n\n\n12.) Was instrument calibration performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\n\nWater temperature is a parameter that is “verified” rather than calibrated. The hand-held water temperature probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level defined in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory, according to instrument recommendations.\n\n\n13.) Was instrument verification during the field season performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\n\nThe hand-held water temperature probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level define in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory, according to instrument recommendations.\n\n\n14.) Were instrument calibration verification logs or records kept?\n\nYes. These records are held at Kenai Watershed Forum, 44129 Sterling Hwy, Soldotna, AK.\n\n\n15.) Do the instrument data files site IDs, time stamps and file names match?\n\nInstrument files were not employed in 2021. Measurements from hand held probes were recorded on waterproof paper field forms.\n\n\n16.) Is any insitu field data rejected and why?\n\nNo insitu data is rejected from 5/11/2021 or 7/27/2021.\n\n\n17.) Were preservation, hold time and temperature requirements met?\n\nYes. Summer and Spring 2021 holding time requirements were met for all samples. See downloadable files below. Laboratory result documents indicated no compromises of preservation and temperature requirements.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Table of Maximum Holding Times for Each Sample Type\n\n\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(epa_analysis_id)`\n\n\n\n\nDownload Holding Time Calculations for Spring and Summer 2021 Field Samples\n\n\n\n18.) Are dissolved metal quantities less than total metals quantities?\n\nDissolved metals results are not consistently less than total metals results, as would be anticipated (see Flowlink website for description and rationale.)\nIn 2021, there are results available for both dissolved and total metals for three elements: Ca, Fe, and Mg; for sites at and downstream of RM 31.\nDissolved metals results are available for 7/27/2021 (summer) only, and not for 5/11/2021 (spring); see question #3 in this sequence.\nResults:\n\nCalcium: all available observations show dissolved metals > total metals\nIron: all available observations show dissolved metals < total metals\nMagnesium: nearly all available observations show dissolved metals < total metals, with the exception of three sites, all near the Kenai River mouth\n\n\n\n\nDownload 2021 Calcium data, total vs dissolved\n\n\nDownload 2021 Iron data, total vs dissolved\n\n\nDownload 2021 Magnesium data, total vs dissolved\n\n\n\nSee discussion XX in “Summary” section of this report for plans in future years to address the issue of dissolved metals values being greater than total metals values in some cases.\n\n19.) Are the duplicate sample(s) RPD (Relative Percent Difference) within range described in QAPP?\nIn 2021, field duplicate samples were collected at two sites on both 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021:\n\nNo Name Creek (Tributary, RM0)\nFunny River (Tributary, RM30)\n\nFollowing the example in the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation 2021 Kenai River Metals Field Report (Apsens and Petitt 2022): “… a set of paired samples was evaluated for RPD only if:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were above the [LOQ)]; AND if\nb.) one or both of the samples were at least two times the [LOQ].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADEC. 2020. “18 AAC 70 Water Quality Standards.” https://dec.alaska.gov/media/1046/18-aac-70.pdf.\n\n\nApsens, S, and J Petitt. 2022. “Kenai River, Alaska Field Report 2021.”"
