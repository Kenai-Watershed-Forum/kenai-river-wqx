    "text": "This report summarizes water quality data collected between summer 2000 and summer 2021 from 22 sampling locations in the Kenai River mainstem and its tributaries. Local, state, federal, and tribal government entities, as well as several local non‐profits formed a cooperative partnership so that sampling teams from various agencies were able to collect water samples twice per year, once in the spring and once in the summer. This biannual effort continues beyond the publication of this report. The locations of the sampling sites are identified with maps, GPS coordinates, and photographs. Trends in the data are highlighted, and the results are compared to the Alaska and federal water quality standards for freshwater aquatic life.\nThe water quality data focuses on metals, nutrients, hydrocarbons, fecal coliform bacteria, and various field parameters. Dissolved metals in this analysis include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc. Calcium, iron, and magnesium were reported as total metals. Additionally, the report addresses the nutrients nitrate and phosphorus. Hydrocarbons parameters include diesel range organics, gasoline range organics, residual range organics, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene. Fecal coliform bacteria, pH, specific conductance, total suspended solids, turbidity, and water temperature are the remaining parameters included in the analysis.\nThe results are displayed in graphs with associated written analyses and tables. The graphs display the median and variance for each parameter at a specific location, and these graphs are separated depending on whether the data was collected in the spring or in the summer. In some cases, parameters were present in levels that could not be detected by available laboratory analysis methods, and when this occurred with over 80% of the samples, scatter plots have been displayed omitting the unknown low levels.\n[previous reports published in 2007 and 2016]\n[Text from 2016 report: A trend analysis was conducted for the following parameters: Lead, Zinc and BTEX; based on the nature of the data, a polynomial line was used because it is the best way to capture and represent the fluctuations in the data.]\nComplete data tables can be found in Appendix XXX and XXX, which are organized by parameter and site location, respectively.",

Six species of anadromous Pacific salmonids flourish in the Kenai River watershed, with sockeye (red) and Chinook (king) salmon as the primary species of interest for harvest and sport fisheries (Schoen et al. 2017). The Kenai River his historically produced 80% of the sockeye harvested in Cook Inlet (Dorava and Milner 2000).\nSurface runoff, groundwater composition, natural minerals, aquatic plants and animals, and human activities can affect water quality in this area. Potential sources of pollution from humans include gasoline powered boat engines, agriculture, mining, street runoff, and perforated septic tanks (Glass, RL 1999; Reeves et al. 2018; EPA 2011).",

The “Alaska Water Quality Criteria Manual for Toxic and other Deleterious Organic and Inorganic Substances” (2022) document, along with the “Inorganic Toxics Criteria Worksheet” provide parameter-specific formulas for many substances.\nHardness-dependent criteria is calculated from the following formula for metals in freshwater:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcute (dissolved) = exp{mA[ln(hardness)]+ bA} (CF) Chronic (dissolved) = exp{mC [ln(hardness)] + bC} (CF)\n\n\n\nwhere mA, bA, mC, and bC are numerical parameters specific to each substance, and CF is the conversion factor for acute vs. chronic criteria.\nThese values are graphically displayed in the following chapters. Rather than juxtaposed against static horizontal lines, instead they are highlighted by shape or color when the calculated threshold is exceeded; specific to that sampling event’s hardness conditions.

In other cases, the individual substances are quantified separately. In yet other cases, both the individual values and the total mixture values are reported separately. To create a consistent parameter, we summed the total quantities of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene by unique sampling event (unique location/time) when it had not already been reported as such.\nIn some cases, multiple isomers of the same hydrocarbon are quantified (e.g. o-xylene vs m,p-xylene).

    "text": "Download Arsenic Kenai River Baseline Data.csv\n\n\n\nFrom 2016 report:\nNatural sources of arsenic in the Cook Inlet Basin include volcanic ash, glaciation, and mineral deposits. Only a minimal contribution of arsenic results from human activities like wood preservation (Glass and Frenzel, 2001). Arsenic is naturally present as a compound in rocks within the Kenai River Watershed, and as a dissolved metal, it can be acutely or chronically toxic to fish (Glass, 1999). The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have set the standard at 150 micrograms per liter (µg/L) for freshwater aquatic life chronically exposed to arsenic and 10 micrograms per liter (µg/L) for drinking water (Appendix X) (USEPA, 2014; ADEC, 2008).\nNone of the samples exceeded the Alaska or federal standard for freshwater aquatic life at any sampling location in spring or summer. The highest level detected in the mainstem was 46.5 µg/L at Mile 1.5 in May 2007, and arsenic was not detected on many occasions below the method detection limit (MDL) of 0.25 µg/L (Table 6). In the Kenai River mainstem, Mile 1.5 had the highest median level in the spring event and summer monitoring event, followed by Mile 6.5 in the spring event and Mile 23 during the summer monitoring event (figures X & X). In the mainstem, higher arsenic levels occurred in the spring samples, while the tributaries levels were higher during the summer with more detected levels between the years 2007-2014 than any of the previous years. (Tables X & X)\nThe highest concentration on the mainstem occurred at Mile 1.5 where arsenic was detected on every sampling event after 2005, while arsenic was detected on all sampling dates at Beaver Creek, Soldotna Creek, and Moose River. The concentrations of arsenic ranged from a high of 12.8 µg/L in Soldotna Creek in summer 2014 to below the MDL of 0.25 µg/L in many locations. Of the tributaries, Soldotna Creek had the highest median level, followed by Moose River and then Beaver Creek in summer and Soldotna, Beaver and Moose in spring. No Name Creek had the fewest incidences of arsenic detection of all the tributaries. (Tables X & X)\nWhen comparing the arsenic levels to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation standards for drinking water, the main stem at Mile 1.5 is the only station that presents multiple exceedances. All exceedances took place during the spring sampling events. (Tables X & X)\nConcentrations of arsenic are generally lower in surface streams than in groundwater, which is typically the source of drinking water (Glass and Frenzel, 2001). The USEPA set the criterion for arsenic in drinking water at 10 µg/L because arsenic has been linked to cancer, skin damage, and circulatory problems (USEPA, 2003). Although the levels of arsenic reported in this study do not exceed the national criterion for the health of an aquatic community in freshwater, groundwater may contain concentrations that are hazardous to human health, and all sources of drinking water should be tested for arsenic.",

Lead is a component in electroplating, metallurgy, construction materials, plastic, and electronic equipment, and it can enter surface water through precipitation, dust, street runoff, and wastewater discharges (USEPA, 1980b). Exposure to lead can cause delayed embryonic development, reduced growth, and suppressed reproduction in fish, and spinal deformities in rainbow trout fry (USEPA, 1980b). Determined by the ADEC and the USEPA, the standard for lead ranges from 0.300 to 10.94 μg/L, depending on hardness, for the chronic exposure of aquatic life in freshwater (Appendix X) (ADEC, 2008; USEPA, 2014).\nThe highest concentration of lead in the mainstem was 468 μg/L and was sampled at Mile 31 during summer 2005, and the lowest levels occurred below the MDL of 0.030 μg/L at many locations in the spring and the summer of the sampling years. Exceedances occurred mainly in the summer, when lead exceeded the criteria twice at Mile 21, and once at Mile 1.5, Mile 6.5, Mile 10.1, Mile 12.5, Mile 31, and Mile 82, Mile 1.5 and Mile 6.5 exhibited the most instances of detection in the spring and the summer. At Mile 40, Mile 43 and Mile 74 (Russian River) no concentrations of lead were ever reported. Only two exceedances where recorded during the spring sampling events, once at Mile 6.5 and once at Mile 10 (Beaver Creek) (Table X).\nThe concentration of lead in the tributaries ranged from a high of 3.92 μg/L at Beaver Creek in summer 2006, and the lowest levels were below the MDL of 0.030 μg/L at many locations in the spring and summer sampling events. The Killey River and Juneau Creek each exceeded the criteria on one occasion in the summer of 2004 and 2013 respectively. Beaver Creek had two exceedances, one in the spring of 2011 and one in the summer of 2006. No lead was ever reported in Russian River. The MDLs were higher than the standard from summer 2000 through summer 2003 and summer 2005, so it is unknown whether exceedances occurred in many of these samples (Table X).\nA trend analysis was conducted using the average and median values for all data collected during the time period between years 2000-2014. The concentrations of lead throughout the entire Kenai River are relatively high in the lower river and decrease as you move towards the upper river (Figure X and Figure X). A similar analysis was done for each sampling station at the Kenai River with results showing that no lead was found in most of the sampling stations before year 2005, after year 2005 when lead has been found it shows a decrease in concentration through time. It is important to note that not every station has an actual reading and in many cases there are very few readings or non- at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Lead Kenai River Baseline Data.csv",

Additional zinc can enter surface water because it is widely used for galvanizing steel, as an alloy, in rubber, and in paint (USEPA, 1987). More recent studies suggest that higher concentrations of Zinc in suburban areas can be caused by tire wear (USGS, 2012). The ADEC and the USEPA have set the standard for zinc ranging from 23.4 to 382.4 μg/L, depending on hardness, for the chronic exposure of freshwater aquatic life (see Appendix X) (ADEC, 2008; USEPA, 2014).\nThe highest level recorded in the mainstem was 2900 μg/L in summer 2000 at Mile 21, and the lowest level occurred at Mile 31 in summer 2006 with a concentration of 0.521 μg/L. In the spring, exceedances occurred at every sampling station except Mile 40 and Mile 50. More exceedances in the mainstem occurred during the summer with eight exceedances at Mile 10.1, seven exceedances at Mile 18, five exceedances at both Mile 6.5 and Mile 12.5. Mile 21 and Mile 23 present four exceedances. Mile 1.5 and Mile 31 present three exceedances. Miles 40, 50, 70 and 82 all present two exceedances. Mile 40 one exceedance (Table 11). The Kenai River estuary had higher median concentrations than the rest of the river in spring, during the summer events this pattern was not clear. Relatively higher medians also occurred at Mile 31, Mile 21, and Mile 10.1 in the summer (Figure X & X).\nZinc concentrations in the tributaries ranged from a high of 247 μg/L in Beaver Creek during spring 2011 to a low of 0.462 μg/L in Russian River during spring 2009. In the spring, exceedances of the criteria occurred eight times at No Name Creek, Beaver Creek and Slikok Creek. Seven times at Funny River, four at Soldotna Creek And Killey River one at Moose River and Russian River. In the other tributaries, exceedances occurred twice at Beaver Creek and Funny River and once at Soldotna Creek and the Killey River during the spring. In the summer, exceedances occurred six times at Killey River, four times at No Name Creek and Beaver Creek, once at Slikok Creek, Russian River and Juneau Creek. Beaver Creek had the highest median of all the tributaries, with No Name Creek and Funny River close behind in the spring (Table X). In the summer No Name Creek had the highest median of all the tributaries, with Beaver Creek and Soldotna Creek close behind. In the tributaries, zinc concentrations and the number of exceedances were greater in the spring. In the spring and the summer of 2003, the MRL of 50 μg/L was higher than most of the standards, so incidences of exceedance are unknown in many of these samples (Figure X & X).\nA trend analysis was conducted using the average and median values for all data collected during the time period between years 2000-2014. The concentrations of zinc throughout the entire Kenai River show a relative decrease from Mile 1.5 to Mile 50 and a relative increase at Mile 70 and Mile 82. This pattern is visible during both the spring and summer sampling events (Figure X-X). A similar analysis was run for each sampling station at the Kenai River. During the spring all the stations present a relative decrease in zinc concentrations until year 2008, after that a low increase is apparent at all stations. For the summer the same general trend is visible, with a stronger increase pattern after year 2008 (Figure X-X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Zinc Kenai River Baseline Data.csv",

The ADEC and USEPA standards for fecal coliform bacteria have two types of critera, a 30-day geometric mean and a no more than 10% of the samples can exceed a specified value criteira. The geometric mean criterian was not evaluated in this study because not enough samples were collected during any 30-day period.

The ADEC standard for pH maintains that freshwater may not have a pH less than 6.5 or greater than 8.5 for the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life and wildlife (see Appendix 2) (ADEC, 2012). Additionally, the standard stipulates that the pH may not vary more than 0.5 pH units from natural conditions and that in any water with a pH naturally outside the specified range, variation of pH must be toward the specified range (ADEC, 2012).\nIn the mainstem, the pH ranged from a high of 8.52 at Mile 50 in summer 2002 to a low of 6.16 at Mile 10.1 in summer of 2010 (Table 27).

Erosion increases the amount of suspended sediment in surface water and can be naturally caused by glaciers, fires, and floods (Glass, 1999). In the Cook Inlet Basin, glaciers are the main cause of erosion, but mining, logging, construction, and recreation can also contribute to elevated levels of suspended sediment (Glass, 1999). High concentrations of suspended sediment can be lethal to post-larval fish, and incubating eggs can suffer severe mortality rates because settled sediment prevents the exchange of oxygen (Glass, 1999). As such, the ADEC standard requires that fine sediment in the range of 0.1 mm to 4.0 mm cannot increase over 5% by weight higher than natural conditions in gravel beds used by anadromous or resident fish for spawning, and the sediment can never exceed a maximum of 30% by weight in freshwater for the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life, and wildlife (see Appendix 2) (ADEC, 2012). More generally, the ADEC standard also states that the amount of deposited or suspended sediment cannot cause adverse effects on aquatic life, including their habitat and reproduction (ADEC, 2012).\nThe concentration of 2073 mg/L at Mile 6.5 during spring 2006 was the highest level of total suspended solids recorded in the mainstem, and the lowest concentration was less than the MDL of 0.48 mg/L during spring and summer sampling events (Table X). The estuary had much higher medians than the rest of the mainstem in both the summer and the spring. The medians were lowest in the spring and the summer in the Upper River from Mile 82 to Mile 50. Between Mile 50 and Mile 43, the concentration of total suspended solids increased, possibly due to the influence of the Killey River, which had higher levels of total suspended solids than the mainstem, especially in the summer. From Mile 43 to Mile 18, the medians in the spring and the summer for total suspended solids decreased relatively, and then there was an increase in the medians from Mile 12.5 to the estuary. During the spring, the concentrations in the estuary were significantly higher than in the summer, but this pattern was not as clear in the remainder of the mainstem (Figure X).\nIn the tributaries, the concentration of total suspended solids ranged from a high of 748 mg/L in Beaver Creek in spring 2009 to a low of less than the MDL of 0.48 mg/L (Table X).

Turbidity varies naturally; higher turbidities are typically found in watersheds fed by glacial melt water, and turbidity generally increases from headwater tributaries to mainstems and estuaries (Bash and others, 2001). Even though salmonids can naturally live in turbid water systems, they do not always cope well with increases in suspended sediments, and these high levels in suspended sediments can cause fatalities, while lower levels can result in difficulty finding food, reduced growth, increased stress, and difficulty migrating (Bash and others, 2001). The ADEC standard states that turbidity may not exceed 25 NTU above natural conditions in freshwater or 5 NTU above natural conditions in lakes for the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life, and wildlife (see Appendix X) (ADEC, 2012).\nThe highest level of turbidity occurred at Mile 6.5 in spring 2006 and was detected at 3200 NTU, and the lowest level in the mainstem was 1 NTU at Mile 70 in spring 2009 (Table 30). The highest medians and degree of variance for turbidity were in the estuary for both the spring and the summer, and the lowest median occurred at Mile 50. In the summer, from Mile 43 to Mile 1.5, the median level of turbidity generally increased. The spring medians in the estuary and Upper River were higher than the summer medians, but the rest of the mainstem had higher medians in the summer (Figure X).\nIn the tributaries, the highest level of turbidity was 336 NTU at Beaver Creek in spring 2010, and the lowest level was at Russian River with the level of 0.02 NTU from summer 2006 (Table X). During the summer, the Killey River had the highest median at 41 NTU, while the other tributaries all had medians less than 20 NTU. In the spring, Beaver Creek had the highest median, followed by No Name Creek and then Funny River. Russian River had the lowest turbidity median in both the summer and the spring. Killey River exhibited the largest seasonal difference in medians by increasing around 35 NTU from the spring to the summer. In contrast, Beaver Creek decreased approximately 13.3 NTU during the summer. The tributaries did not display a clear seasonal trend for increased or decreased turbidity (Figure X).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Turbidity Kenai River Baseline Data.csv",

    "text": "Water temperature varies seasonally and as a result of glacial activity and anthropogenic sources. Low water temperatures between 0°C and 4°C can result in low growth rates for fish, but much higher water temperatures can encourage disease, competitors, predators, mortality, and an oxygen-deprived habitat (Kyle and Brabets, 2001). The ADEC has five temperature standards for the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life, and wildlife in freshwater; the water temperature must remain below 20°C in all areas, below 15°C in rearing areas and migration routes, and below 13°C in egg and fry incubation and spawning areas (see Appendix X) (ADEC, 2012).\nThe highest temperature recorded on the mainstem occurred at Mile 1.5 in the summer of 2014 with a value of 17.02°C, and the lowest recorded temperature along the mainstem was –0.15°C at Mile 12.5 in spring 2002 (Table X). In the spring, two of the temperatures exceeded the standard for rearing areas and migration routes. There was a general upward trend from Mile 82 to Mile 1.5. It is important to notice that during the sampling event of the spring 2014, twelve out of thirteen sites exceeded the standard for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas. During the summer, the medians at Mile 1.5, Mile 6.5 and Mile 50 were very close to exceeding the standards for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas, and no medians exceeded the other standards. There was a general upward trend from Mile 82 to Mile 1.5, with an upward jump in the median at Mile 50, the outlet of Skilak Lake (Figure X).\nIn the tributaries, the highest temperature was 19°C in the Moose River during summer 2003, and the lowest temperature was –0.21°C in the Killey River during spring 2002 (Table X). In the spring, No Name Creek, Soldotna Creek and Russian River exceeded the standards for rearing areas and migration routes. Also, Slikok Creek, Funny River and Moose River exceeded the standard for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas. All tributaries had medians below 5°C, with the highest at Russian River and the lowest at Funny River. During the summer, the medians of Beaver Creek, Soldotna Creek, and Moose River exceeded the standards for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas, and the median at Moose River also exceeded the standards for rearing areas and migration routes. The coldest tributary in the summer was the Killey River, followed by Juneau Creek, Funny River and then Slikok Creek. The median water temperatures were higher in the summer than in the spring for all sampling locations in both the mainstem and the tributaries. For this analysis there were no values available for temperature during the sampling event of spring 2012 (Figure X).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Temperature, water Kenai River Baseline Data.csv",

    "text": "A.1.1 Year 2021 Water Quality Data\nIn this appendix we will collate 2021 laboratory data from several sources into a single spreadsheet document with a consistent format. The desired end format is a spreadsheet template provided by the EPA Water Quality Exchange. These template files are available to download from the EPA at https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-exchange-web-template-files.\nOnce the data is collated, it will be evaluated according to a Quality Assurance Checklist (template example provided by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Soldotna office). Field observations that do not meet the quality assurance standards described in the evaluation checklist will be flagged before being uploaded to the EPA WQX.\nData that has been uploaded to the EPA WQX is evaluated biannually by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in their Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report1. The integrated report evaluates available water quality data from the previous five years against Alaska water quality standards and regulations (ADEC 2020).\n\nA.1.1.1 2021 Water Quality Data AQWMS Formatting\nThe code scripts in this document assemble water quality data from the three analytical laboratories that partnered with Kenai Watershed Forum for this project in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories (Anchorage, AK)\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (Soldotna, AK)\nTaurianen Engineering and Testing (Soldotna, AK)\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.1 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results (SGS Labs)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n*Note: the chain of custody documents for SGS Laboratories are integrated into the above downloadable PDF files.\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.2 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP)/Taurianen Engineering)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results from SWWTP\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results from Taurianen\n\n\n\n\nDownload Spring 2021 Fecal Coliform Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\nDownload Summer 2021 Fecal Coliform Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.3 2021 Total Suspended Solids Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP))\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP.xlsx\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP.xlsx\n\n\n\n\nDownload Spring 2021 Total Suspended Solids Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\nDownload Summer 2021 Total Suspended Solids Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.2 2021 Provisional Results, Prior to QA/QC Review\nResults last updated 2025-01-10\nThe above data sources have been collated in to a single .csv file (available for download) into a format compatible with the EPA Water Quality Exchange.

The draft Data Evaluation Checklist Template (available for download below) outlines these questions:\n\n\nDownload 2021 Draft Kenai Baseline Data Evaluation Checklist Template\n\n\n\nA.1.3.1 Pre-Database\n\nA.1.3.1.1 Overall Project Success\nNote: the sequence of questions is structured such that data will be gradually flagged at each step based on the criteria described.\n1.) Were the appropriate analytical methods used for all parameters?\nYes. Analytical methods from the approved 2020 QAPP were employed.\n\n2.) Were there any deviations from the sampling plan?\nAll sites were visited as planned on 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021. Most intrinsic water quality parameters measured with instruments (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity) were not measured, which is a deviation of from the QAPP.\n\n3.) Were field duplicates, blanks, and/or other QC samples collected as planned?\n\n\nDownload Planned vs. Actual Analysis Results for 2021, Kenai Baseline\n\n\n\nTo see a table comparing planned vs actual results for 2021, download and view the csv file linked above.\nFrom the above table we can see that there are deviations between planned results and actual results available. These reasons for the deviations are known and are attributable to two causes:\nCause 1: The Spring 2021 Chain of Custody (COC) from KWF to SGS was completed erroneously. The COC specified for EPA Method 200.8 analyses (dissolved metals) to be complete for all sites (when they should have stopped upstream of Morgan’s Landing RM31), and it also specified for EPA Method 200.7 analyses (total metals) to stop upstream of Morgan’s Landing (when they should have been performed for all sites in the project).\nAs a result, for Spring 2021 total metals data will be unavailable for sites upstream of the Morgan’s Landing RM31 site.\nCause 2: For Summer 2021, the SGS laboratory performed the EPA Method 200.8 analyses (dissolved metals) for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes as requested. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free. In this case., there are no consequences of deviating from the planned analyses).\n\n4.) Do the laboratory reports provide results for all sites and parameters?\nThe laboratory reports provide results for all sites, and for all parameters, with the exceptions outlined above in question #3.\n\n5.) Is a copy of the Chain of Custody included with the laboratory reports?\nWe worked with three separate laboratories in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories, Anchorage, AK\n\nChain of Custody documents are included within the PDF laboratory reports linked above earlier in this appendix.\n\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant, Soldotna, AK\n\nChain of Custody documents are on file with Kenai Watershed Forum for fecal coliform and total suspended solids for 5/11/2021, and for total suspended solids on 7/27/2021.\n\nTauriainen Engineering & Testing, Soldotna, AK\n\nAn individual document for each sample reports the time and date of delivery and analysis for each sample. These documents are included with the PDF laboratory reports linked above earlier in this appendix.\n\n\n\n6.) Do the laboratory reports match the Chain of Custody and requested methods throughout?\nThe laboratory reports match the Chain of Custody and requested methods, with the one exception discussed in question #3.\nFor summer 2021, the SGS laboratory performed the EPA Method 200.8 analyses for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes as requested. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free. In this case., there are no consequences of deviating from the planned analyses).\n\n7.) Are the number of samples on the laboratory reports the same as on the Chain of Custody?\nThe quantity of sample bottles sent to the laboratories matches the number of analyzed samples for samples collected and delivered on 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021.\n\n8.) Was all supporting info provided in the laboratory report, such as reporting limits for all analyses and definitions?\nWe worked with three separate laboratories in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories, Anchorage, AK\n\nSGS provided data as PDFs which included reporting limits, as well as in the form of an Electronic Data Deliverable where this information is also included in column format.\n\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP), Soldotna, AK\n\nSWWTP provided data in the form of .xls files. Reporting limits are described in this project’s current Quality Assurance Action Plan.\n\nTauriainen Engineering & Testing, Soldotna, AK\n\nTauriainen provided data in the form of PDF documents. Reporting limits are described in this project’s current Quality Assurance Action Plan.\n\n\n\n9.) Are site names, dates, and times correct and as expected?\n\nYes, after post-season correction documented in this report. Notes: In 2021 Kenai Watershed Forum used pre-printed waterproof labels on all sample bottles, reducing opportunity for field and lab transcription errors. Remaining site name transcription errors from laboratories were corrected in post-season data review, using scripted code that did not modify the original report.\n\n\n10.) Were there any issues with instrument calibration?\n\nInstruments to measure intrinsic water quality parameters (sondes; to measure pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity) were not employed in 2021.\nTeams did use hand-held probes to record water temperature on-site. Prior to field use, the hand-held probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level defined in the QAPP using an ice bath in the Kenai Watershed Forum laboratory.\n\n\n11.) Did the instruments perform as expected?\n\nThe hand-held water temperature probes performed as expected in 2021.\n\n\n12.) Was instrument calibration performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\n\nWater temperature is a parameter that is “verified” rather than calibrated. The hand-held water temperature probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level defined in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory, according to instrument recommendations.\n\n\n13.) Was instrument verification during the field season performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\n\nThe hand-held water temperature probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level define in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory, according to instrument recommendations.\n\n\n14.) Were instrument calibration verification logs or records kept?\n\nYes. These records are held at Kenai Watershed Forum, 44129 Sterling Hwy, Soldotna, AK.\n\n\n15.) Do the instrument data files site IDs, time stamps and file names match?\n\nInstrument files were not employed in 2021. Measurements from hand held probes were recorded on waterproof paper field forms.\n\n\n16.) Is any insitu field data rejected and why?\n\nNo insitu data is rejected from 5/11/2021 or 7/27/2021.\n\n\n17.) Were preservation, hold time and temperature requirements met?\n\nYes. Summer and Spring 2021 holding time requirements were met for all samples. See downloadable files below. Laboratory result documents indicated no compromises of preservation and temperature requirements.\n\n\n\nDownload Table of Maximum Holding Times for Each Sample Type\n\n\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(epa_analysis_id)`\n\n\n\n\nDownload Holding Time Calculations for Spring and Summer 2021 Field Samples\n\n\n\n18.) Are dissolved metal quantities less than total metals quantities?\n\nDissolved metals results are not consistently less than total metals results, as would be logically anticipated (see post from Flowlink Environmental website for description and rationale):\n\n“Dissolved metal concentration is determined by filtering a water sample through 0.45 uM filter. Water that passes through the filter is analyzed for metals and the result is reported as dissolved metal concentration. Total metal concentration is determined by analyzing the unfiltered sample.\n“Total metal concentration = Dissolved metal concentration + Particulate (insoluble) metal concentration.”\nIn 2021, there are results available for both dissolved and total metals for three elements: Ca, Fe, and Mg; for sites at and downstream of RM 31.\nDissolved metals results are available for 7/27/2021 (summer) only, and not for 5/11/2021 (spring); see question #3 in this sequence.\n\nResults:\n\nCalcium: all available observations show dissolved metals &gt; total metals\nIron: all available observations show dissolved metals &lt; total metals\nMagnesium: nearly all available observations show dissolved metals &lt; total metals, with the exception of three sites, all near the Kenai River mouth\n\n\n\n\nDownload 2021 Calcium data, total vs dissolved\n\n\nDownload 2021 Iron data, total vs dissolved\n\n\nDownload 2021 Magnesium data, total vs dissolved\n\n\n\nAs of Fall 2023 it is unclear why the values measured for total metals is greater than dissolved metals for the cases described above.\nSee discussion XX in “Summary” section of this report for plans in future years to address the issue of dissolved metals values being greater than total metals values in some cases.\n\n19.) Are the duplicate sample(s) RPD (Relative Percent Difference) within range described in QAPP?\nIn 2021, field duplicate samples were collected at two sites on both 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021:\n\nNo Name Creek (Tributary, RM0)\nFunny River (Tributary, RM30)\n\nFollowing the example in the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation 2021 Kenai River Metals Field Report (Apsens and Petitt 2022): “… a set of paired samples was evaluated for RPD only if:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were above the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ); AND if\nb.) one or both of the samples were at least two times the LOQ.”\n\nA csv file of Relative Percent Difference values organized by site, date, and parameter may be downloaded below:\n\n\nDownload 2021 Duplicate Sample Relative Percent Difference Data\n\n\n\nFrom the above downloadable table, we can see that a limited subset of paired values from field duplicates are eligible to be used for RPD calculations for 2021. Pairs of measurements must meet LOQ criteria described above (“a” and “b”) in order to be used. For 2021 data, of 69 paired field duplicate observations, 24 of them meet these criteria and thus may be used for RPD calculations.\nRPD values range from 0 % to 165.22 %.\nIn the 2020 Quality Assurance Action Plan, Relative Percent Difference values for most parameters are set at 20%, with the exception of “Phosphorus, total” and “Nitrates (NO2+NO3)” at 25%, and “Suspended solids, total” at 5%.\nUsing the available RPD values against the above criteria, four paired observations exceed project precision goals in 2021. Three of these four observations are for fecal coliform, and one is for total phosphorus.\nMost other parameters have at least one available RPD value that is within project precision goals defined in the QAPP.\nThe parameters that do not have at least one RPD calculation available, due to the LOQ constraints described above, are the following:\n\nArsenic\nCadmium\nChromium\nCopper\nLead\nZinc\n\nOther notes\nIn 2021 the full suite of dissolved metals was run for method 200.8 on samples from 7/27/2021. However we intend to only submit data for parameters that had a pre-defined QA plan as outlined in the QAPP, which is the case for the following dissolved six metals: Mg, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn.\nSummary of Discussion on RPD (Relative Percent Difference) Values for 2021\nWe attempted to calculate RPD values for all parameters collected in 2021 at two field sites on two dates. For each pair of duplicate observations, one of the following descriptions apply:\n\nIt was possible to calculate RPD values because:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were above the LOQ; AND one or both of the samples were at least two times the LOQ\n\nProject data for this parameter will be submitted unflagged to EPA WQX if RPD values meet project goals outlined in the QAPP\n\n\nIt was not possible to calculate RPD values because:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were not above the LOQ; OR one or both of the samples were not at least two times the LOQ\n\nProject data for this parameter will be submitted unflagged to EPA WQX if both paired values are non-detect\n\n\n\nBest practices for interpreting and applying RPD data in order to flag/not flag the overall dataset are currently being finalized. KWF communicated with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation on August 22, 2023 via an inquiry on this topic. The memo includes a visual flow chart of the logic for when data is flagged, and is available for download below.\n\n\nDownload August 2023 Memo to ADEC regarding RPD Interpretation\n\n\n\nFinal determinations on flagging / not flagging 2021 data submitted to the EPA WQX\nAll 2021 field results will be submitted unflagged to the EPA WQX unless discussed below.\n\nFecal Coliform\n\nGiven that 3 out of 4 RPD values for fecal coliform values are &gt;60%, field data values for the 2021 dataset may vary from actual environmental conditions. The 2020 KWF QAPP does not specify an RPD value for fecal coliform, it only specifies control checks for sterility and temperature. We used EPA Method 9222D (drinking water) for fecal coliform analysis methods, which does not specify an RPD value. However EPA general recommendations for pathogens in sewage sludge recommends and RPD of 20% (link).\nGiven the above considerations, KWF will submit 2021 fecal coliform data to the EPA WQX as “flagged”. Fecal coliform data will be evaluated in this report and assessed against state standards, but given the high RPD values among duplicate samples, 2021 data will likely not be considered in the context of potential regulatory exceedences.\nTO DO: Calculate and visualize RPD values for 2014-2022 and compare, also compare to RPD values in previous comprehensive report.\n\nSelected Dissolved Metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn)\n\nBecause these parameters do not have an associated RPD value from 2021 field data, they will be submitted to EPA WQX as “flagged.”\nNote: beginning in Summer 2022, KWF initiated a series of changes to the QAPP that will better facilitate QA/QC decisions regarding Total Metals and Dissolved metals results. These changes include use of a dissolved metals field blank, and changing from field filtration to lab filtration as standard practice.\n\n\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(activity_start_date, characteristic_name)`\n\n\n\n20.) Were there any laboratory discrepancies, errors, data qualifiers, or QC failures (review laboratory duplicates, matrix spikes and blanks)?\nLaboratory discrepancies and QC failures from the SGS lab are described on page 2 of the spring and summer PDF document reports, which are available for download below.\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\nThe following discrepancies were identified in the results from SGS laboratories:\nMatrix Spike Recoveries\nA total of 6 matrix spike or matrix spike duplicate samples are outside of QC criteria. The limit of recovery range for the analyte “Total Nitrate/Nitrite-N” is 90% - 110%. For these matrix spike measurements outside of the QC criteria, recovery levels range from 112% - 118%. The subset of sample values that exceed threshold may be downloaded as a table below:\n\n\nDownload Matrix Spike Recovery Values Exceeding Threshold for 2021 Sample Analyses\n\n\n\nNo additional laboratory QA/QC anomalies for any other parameters were noted by any laboratories contracted in 2021. Additional details are available upon request at hydrology@kenaiwatershed.org\nAs of 2025-01-10, “Total Nitrate/Nitrite-N” values will be flagged for the spring 2021 dataset. (Spring only and not summer because no matrix spike recovery exedences were observed from the summer 2021 lab results). The matrix spike recovery exceedances indicate that reported lab values may be 2% - 7% above actual field values. At a later date we will evaluate these results in the context of year 2000 - present data to help evaluate the relevancy of this flag.\n\n21.) Is any laboratory data rejected and why?\nNo additional 2021 laboratory data currently indicates a need for being flagged or rejected.\n\n22.) During the field season, review raw data files (EDDs [Electronic Data Deliverables], instrument records) as they are received. Document changes and corrections to methods as needed.\nIn 2021, KWF initiated as standard practice the receipt of machine-readable EDD files from contracted laboratories, in addition to PDF results. The EDD files are being reviewed as part of this QA/QC process, which was initiated in Winter 2022.\n\n23.) Is the dataset complete and did you receive the expected number of results?\nFrom the discussion and results in question #3, deviations are evident between planned and actual results reported. The reasons for the deviations are known and are attributable to the two factors discussed in question #3, and thus not concerning to project integrity.\n\n24.) Was the data collected representative of environmental conditions?.\nThe data collected in this project is representative of seasonal hydrological conditions on two fieldwork days in 2021. Conditions vary instantaneously thus this dataset serves to provide representative longitudinal snapshots of the watershed across space on the two dates.\nFlagged data indicates that lab results may not be representative of environmental conditions, and thus may require additional interpretation or exclusion from analysis.\n\n25.) Does project meet Completeness Measure A criteria?\nFrom the QAPP, Completeness Measure A: “the primary number of samples collected divided by the usable number of samples submitted to ADEC, with a goal of 85% completeness.” (Note that as of 2023 results are now submitted directly to EPA rather than DEC, per request of DEC).\n(Note: metals parameters not specified in the QAPP are excluded from these analyses. In 2021, SGS laboratories provided dissolved metals results for parameters beyond what was originally requested.)\nWe calculated Completeness Measure A at the following project scales:\n\nFor individual parameters\nFor individual sites\nAs a project whole\n\n\n\nDownload Completeness Measure A Results, By Parameter\n\n\nDownload Completeness Measure A Results, By Site\n\n\nDownload Completeness Measure A Results, By Overall\n\n\n\nDiscussion on “Completeness Measure A” Results\nBased on the data flagging decisions discussed in the previous questions, the 2021 dataset did not achieve all Completeness Measure A goals.\nWhen completeness results were summarized by parameter, all dissolved metals had a value of 0% for Completeness Measure A since the decision was made to flag these as a result of an inability to calculate Relative Percent Difference values.\nWhen completeness results were summarised by Site, Completeness Measure A values ranged from 44.4% - 71.4%, depending on the site’s sampling plan.\nWhen completeness results are summarized for the overall 2021 dataset, Completeness Measure A is calculated at 50.1%; indicating that 49.9% of the overall result values were flagged.\n\n26.) Does project meet Completeness Measure B criteria?\nFrom the QAPP, Completeness Measure B: “the planned number of samples divided by the useable samples (submitted to ADEC) with a goal of 60%.”\nFor these calculations, we will consider “usable” as “unflagged,” and will calculate at the following scales:\n\nFor individual parameters (analysis methods)\nFor individual sites\nAs a project whole\n\nWork still in progress on calculating Completness Measures B as of 2025-01-10\n\n27.) Was the QA officer consulted for any data concerns?\nNote: the 2012 and 2019 approved Quality Assurance Action Plan (QAPP) documents list Alaska Dept of Environmental Conservation Staff as the project’s QA officer (Kenai Watershed Forum 2012, 2019), whereas the 2023 approved QAPP lists Kenai Watershed Forum staff as the project QA officer (Kenai Watershed Forum 2023).\nKenai Watershed Forum consulted regularly with staff from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation and EPA Region 10 Office in order to prepare 2021 field data and confirm field methods and data QA/QC procedures.\n\n28.) Are the correct monitoring locations associated with the project? Are latitude and longitude filled out in a consistent format?\nWe used the leaflet package to generate a map of unique sites from the 2021 dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above map we can see that coordinates for the 2021 field sites correspond to the locations listed in the Quality Assurance Project Plan, thus they are filled out in a consistent format.\n\n29.) Are the QAPP and other supporting documents attached?\nThe QAPP will be included and attached in the data submission to the EPA WQX. Find the current approved QAPP posted on Kenai Watershed Forum’s website at https://www.kenaiwatershed.org/news-media/qapp-revisions-completed-2023/.\n\n30.) Is all project metadata correct?\nAnswer TBD. More detail applied here once upload is complete.\n\n31.) Is the organization ID correct?\nKenai Watershed Forum’s Organization ID in the EPA Water Quality Exchange is “Kenai_WQX.” This value is manually confirmed during the upload process.\n\n32.) Are the time zones consistent and correct (AKDT in summer)?\nAll times zones are listed as AKDT.\n\n33.) Are all media types included? Media types appropriate to Characteristic?\n“Water” is the only media type considered in this project. All “Characteristics” (parameters) are measured from water samples or in-situ water conditions.\n\n34.) Check Sample Collection, Preparation and Preservation Methods, Thermal Preservative, Equipment ID, Activity Media. Is supporting information included and correct??\n\n\n[1] \"Water Bottle\"\n\n\n“Sample collection method”: all sample values have “Equipment ID” listed as “Water Bottle.”\n“Preparation”:this information corresponds to the “result sample fraction” column\n“Preservation Methods”: this information corresponds to the “preservative” and “thermal preservative” columns.\n\n35.) Are all expected activity types present and are QC samples correctly identified?\n\n\n[1] \"Field Msr/Obs\"                          \n[2] \"Quality Control Field Replicate Msr/Obs\"\n[3] \"Quality Control Sample-Trip Blank\"      \n\n\n\nThe activity types present are listed above. All three types were planned and anticipated. QC samples are described earlier in Question #3.\n\n36.) Is the Activity media subdivision filled in (if relevant)?\n\n\n[1] \"Surface Water\"\n\n\nAll “Activity Media Subdivision” names are listed as “Surface Water.”\n\n37.) For Water activity media, is the relative depth filled in?\nYes, “activity depth height measure” and “activity depth height measure unit” are included as columns.\n\n38.) Is the number of results for each Characteristic correct?\nQuestions #2 and #3 address this topic in detail. A summary table of the total number of observations for each characteristic is available in the downloadable table below.\n\n\nDownload Observation Count by Characteristic, 2021 Kenai River Baseline Water Quality\n\n\n\n39.) Do the range of result values make sense?\nPrior to upload to the EPA WQX, the range of results will be evaluated visually and numerically in each characteristic-specific section of the comprehensive report, relative to past results. Likely outliers will be identified and recorded in a dedicated spreadsheet (download below). Each likely outlier will have accompanying notes discussing the choice, and a decisions as to whether a more detailed statistical investigation is warranted.\n\n\nDownload identified potential outliers for 2021 Kenai River Baseline Water Quality data\n\n\n\n40.) Are units correct and consistent for each parameter?\n\n\n  unique.z.result_unit.\n1                  mg/L\n2                  ug/L\n3             cfu/100ml\n4                  mg/l\n\n\nWe observe that equivalent units, “mg/L” and “mg/l”, have slightly different notation among parameters. We will correct this at this step to make terms consistent.\n\n41.) Are detection limits and laboratory qualifiers included for analytical results?\nLaboratory qualifiers including “J” (below limit of quantitation; is an estimate), “=”, (observed value), “U” (below detection limit), and “ND” (Not Detected) are included in the column titled “result_qualifier.”\nDetection limits and their corresponding units are included in columns titled “result_detection_limit_type_1” and in “result_detection_limit_unit_1” corresponding to Limit of Quanititation, and in columns titled “result_detection_limit_type_2” and “result_detection_limit_unit_2” corresponding to Method Detection Level.\n\n42.) Are results trip blanks and/or field blanks above detection limits, and is any related data flagged as a result?\nIn summer 2021, trip blanks were included with those field crews tasked with collection water samples for hydrocarbon analyses. Sites visited by these crews include RM 1.5 - Kenai City Dock, RM 6.5 - Cunningham Park, Rm 40 - Bing’s Landing, and RM 43 - Upstream of Dow Island.\nOn the summer 2021 SGS chain of custody documents, BTEX trip blanks are specified for the above sites. However in the reported results, a single sample named “Trip Blank” is reported. This error resulted from a mis-communication with SGS staff.\nIn this case, all hydrocarbon results in the Trip Blank are reported as below detection limit, suggesting there is not a need to flag summer 2021 hydrocarbon results.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.4 Uploading 2021 data to the EPA Water Quality Exchange (EPA WQX)\nEach water quality dataset that is housed in the EPA WQX consists of three uploads:\n\nProject description\nMonitoring locations\nResults and activities\n\nWe will prepare and finalize each of these uploads here.\n\nA.1.4.1 Project Description\nOn 12/5/2023 we downloaded the KWF Agency Baseline project description datafile from the EPA Water Quality Portal (EPA WQP). The file can be directly accessed at the link below:\n\n\nKenai River Baseline Water Quality Monitoring project details for EPA WQP\n\n\n\nWe found that the project file listed the QAPP (Quality Assurance Project Plan) as “not yet approved.” It is possible that this designation is listed as such because previously approved versions of the QAPP (versions 1.0 and 2.0) do not include signatures from an EPA staff on the Title & Approval page, but were instead approved by Alaska Department of Environment Conservation Staff. For the QAPP approved on 5/9/2023 (version 3.0), two Region 10 EPA staff signed as approvers on the Title & Approval page.\nTo apply this correction, in the “Project” spreadsheet we modified “QAPP Approval Status” from “N” to “Y” and re-uploaded to the EPA Water Quality Exchange in Winter 2023.\n\n\nA.1.4.2 Monitoring locations\nOn 12/5/2023 we downloaded the KWF Agency Baseline project monitoring locations datafile from the EPA Water Quality Portal (EPA WQP). The file can be directly accessed at the link below:\n\n\nDownload Kenai River Baseline Water Quality Monitoring Sites 2021\n\n\n\nWe retained all sites whose column description for “MonitoringLocationName” contained the prefix “KBL” (Kenai Baseline).\nWe plotted locations on a map using the leaflet package, and confirmed that existing site names in the database matched those used in the 2021 dataset.\nIn the EPA WQX Central Data Exchange, we created a custom import configuration to accommodate importing the list of existing sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.4.3 Results and Activities\nWithin Kenai Watershed Forum’s EPA Water Quality Portal web account, we developed an import configuration that accommodated all relevant columns and data types for this project. We based the configuration primarily on the template provided by the Alaska Dept of Environmental Conservation.\nFor this export, we identified as “Rejected” all observations that had been “flagged” throughout the QA/QC process described above. Flagged observations will be uploaded to the EPA WQX labeled as “Rejected” under the column “Result Status ID.”\n\n\nvalue for \"which\" not specified, defaulting to c(\"rows\", \"cols\")\n\n\nNew names:\nJoining with `by = join_by(monitoring_location_id)`\nJoining with `by = join_by(characteristic_name)`\n• `` -&gt; `...5`\n\n\nWarning: Unknown columns: `Monitoring Location Name`\n\n\nOther notes for final 2021 data upload to EPA CDX\n\nPhosphorus from EPA Method 200.8 (Dissloved Metals by ICP/MS) requires a “method speciation”. (This does not apply to “Total Phosphorus”, method SM21 4500P-B,E). However this method does not distinguish speciation. Result Status ID was designated “as P” for this test/parameter. Regardless, this parameter was not included in the QAPP, so is designated as “Rejected” in “Result Status ID”.\n\nWork in progress here as of 2025-01-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADEC. 2020. “18 AAC 70 Water Quality Standards.” https://dec.alaska.gov/media/1046/18-aac-70.pdf.\n\n\nApsens, S, and J Petitt. 2022. “Kenai River, Alaska Field Report 2021.”\n\n\nKenai Watershed Forum. 2012. “Quality Assurance Project Plan, Kenai Watershed Forum, Kenai River Watershed Monitoring Program.”\n\n\n———. 2019. “Quality Assurance Project Plan, Kenai Watershed Forum, Kenai River Watershed Monitoring Program, V2.0.”\n\n\n———. 2023. “Kenai River Water Quality Monitoring Quality Assurance Project Plan, Multi-Agency Baseline (QAPP) V3.0.” Soldotna, AK. https://www.kenaiwatershed.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KenaiWatershedForum_QAPP_v3_2023.pdf.",

Similar levels of annual contribution are not anticipated for future years. Additionally, in 2023 the project received a contribution from Salamatof Tribe via it’s IGAP3 program.
