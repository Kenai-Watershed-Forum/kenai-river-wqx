    "text": "The presence of fecal coliform bacteria in surface water indicates fecal contamination from warm-blooded animals, which is linked to disease-causing viruses and bacteria (Glass, 1999). Sources of fecal coliform bacteria include waste from septic systems, domestic animals, waterfowl, and other wildlife (Glass, 1999). The ADEC and USEPA standards for fecal coliform bacteria have two types of critera, a 30-day geometric mean and a no more than 10% of the samples can exceed a specified value criteira. The geometric mean criterian was not evaluated in this study because not enough samples were collected during any 30-day period. For reference, the ADEC fecal coliform drinking water standard states that in a 30-day period, the geometric mean of samples may not exceed 20 CFU/100ml and not more than 10% of the total samples may exceed 40 CFU/100ml (ADEC’s single sample limit). The ADEC fecal coliform secondary recreation standard states that in a 30-day period, the geometric mean of samples may not exceed 200 CFU/100ml and not more than 10% of the total samples may exceed 400 CFU/100ml (see Appendix X) (ADEC, 2002).\nThe highest level of fecal coliform recorded was 2980 CFU/100ml at Mile 6.5 during the summer 2002, however this sample may be unreliable because the duplicate sample was below the MDL of 1 CFU/100ml. The next highest recorded concentration in the mainstem was 580 CFU/100ml at Mile 6.5 during the summer of 2003, and the lowest levels were 0 CFU/100ml at several locations (Table 26). The highest median in the mainstem occurred at Mile 6.5 in the spring and at Mile 1.5 in the summer. The other medians along the mainstem were all below 10 CFU/100ml for the summer and the spring. The concentration of fecal coliform was generally higher in the summer than in the spring in the mainstem and the tributaries (Figures X - X).\nIn the tributaries, the concentration of fecal coliform ranged from a high of 520 CFU/100ml in Soldotna Creek during spring 2001 to 0 CFU/100ml at multiple sites (Table 52). During the spring, Beaver Creek had the highest median, and during the summer, No Name Creek had the highest median. In the summer, the median concentrations were relatively high in Slikok Creek and Beaver Creek, in addition to No Name Creek. Juneau Creek, Russian River, Killey River, and Moose River all had relatively low medians during the spring and the summer. In the summer, the tributaries had higher median concentrations of fecal coliform than the mainstem, but in the spring, the levels in the tributaries and the mainstem were more similar.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The concentration of total suspended solids is a way of measuring the amount of mineral and organic particles that are transported in the water column (Bash and others, 2001). Erosion increases the amount of suspended sediment in surface water and can be naturally caused by glaciers, fires, and floods (Glass, 1999). In the Cook Inlet Basin, glaciers are the main cause of erosion, but mining, logging, construction, and recreation can also contribute to elevated levels of suspended sediment (Glass, 1999). High concentrations of suspended sediment can be lethal to post-larval fish, and incubating eggs can suffer severe mortality rates because settled sediment prevents the exchange of oxygen (Glass, 1999). As such, the ADEC standard requires that fine sediment in the range of 0.1 mm to 4.0 mm cannot increase over 5% by weight higher than natural conditions in gravel beds used by anadromous or resident fish for spawning, and the sediment can never exceed a maximum of 30% by weight in freshwater for the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life, and wildlife (see Appendix 2) (ADEC, 2012). More generally, the ADEC standard also states that the amount of deposited or suspended sediment cannot cause adverse effects on aquatic life, including their habitat and reproduction (ADEC, 2012).\nThe concentration of 2073 mg/L at Mile 6.5 during spring 2006 was the highest level of total suspended solids recorded in the mainstem, and the lowest concentration was less than the MDL of 0.48 mg/L during spring and summer sampling events (Table X). The estuary had much higher medians than the rest of the mainstem in both the summer and the spring. The medians were lowest in the spring and the summer in the Upper River from Mile 82 to Mile 50. Between Mile 50 and Mile 43, the concentration of total suspended solids increased, possibly due to the influence of the Killey River, which had higher levels of total suspended solids than the mainstem, especially in the summer. From Mile 43 to Mile 18, the medians in the spring and the summer for total suspended solids decreased relatively, and then there was an increase in the medians from Mile 12.5 to the estuary. During the spring, the concentrations in the estuary were significantly higher than in the summer, but this pattern was not as clear in the remainder of the mainstem (Figure X).\nIn the tributaries, the concentration of total suspended solids ranged from a high of 748 mg/L in Beaver Creek in spring 2009 to a low of less than the MDL of 0.48 mg/L (Table X). The Killey River had the highest median and largest variance by far in the summer. Funny River also had a relatively large degree of variance, but had a similar median to the other tributaries, excluding the Killey River in the summer. During the spring, Beaver Creek had the highest median and a relatively large degree of variance. Russian River had the lowest median of total suspended solids in the spring and Juneau Creek in the summer. Excluding Russian River and Killey River, the tributaries had higher medians during the spring rather than the summer.

    "text": "Water temperature varies seasonally and as a result of glacial activity and anthropogenic sources. Low water temperatures between 0°C and 4°C can result in low growth rates for fish, but much higher water temperatures can encourage disease, competitors, predators, mortality, and an oxygen-deprived habitat (Kyle and Brabets, 2001). The ADEC has five temperature standards for the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, other aquatic life, and wildlife in freshwater; the water temperature must remain below 20°C in all areas, below 15°C in rearing areas and migration routes, and below 13°C in egg and fry incubation and spawning areas (see Appendix X) (ADEC, 2012).\nThe highest temperature recorded on the mainstem occurred at Mile 1.5 in the summer of 2014 with a value of 17.02°C, and the lowest recorded temperature along the mainstem was –0.15°C at Mile 12.5 in spring 2002 (Table X). In the spring, two of the temperatures exceeded the standard for rearing areas and migration routes. There was a general upward trend from Mile 82 to Mile 1.5. It is important to notice that during the sampling event of the spring 2014, twelve out of thirteen sites exceeded the standard for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas. During the summer, the medians at Mile 1.5, Mile 6.5 and Mile 50 were very close to exceeding the standards for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas, and no medians exceeded the other standards. There was a general upward trend from Mile 82 to Mile 1.5, with an upward jump in the median at Mile 50, the outlet of Skilak Lake (Figure X).\nIn the tributaries, the highest temperature was 19°C in the Moose River during summer 2003, and the lowest temperature was –0.21°C in the Killey River during spring 2002 (Table X). In the spring, No Name Creek, Soldotna Creek and Russian River exceeded the standards for rearing areas and migration routes. Also, Slikok Creek, Funny River and Moose River exceeded the standard for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas. All tributaries had medians below 5°C, with the highest at Russian River and the lowest at Funny River. During the summer, the medians of Beaver Creek, Soldotna Creek, and Moose River exceeded the standards for egg and fry incubation and spawning areas, and the median at Moose River also exceeded the standards for rearing areas and migration routes. The coldest tributary in the summer was the Killey River, followed by Juneau Creek, Funny River and then Slikok Creek. The median water temperatures were higher in the summer than in the spring for all sampling locations in both the mainstem and the tributaries. For this analysis there were no values available for temperature during the sampling event of spring 2012 (Figure X).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Temperature, water Kenai River Baseline Data.csv",
