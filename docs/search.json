    "section": "A.1 Introduction",
    "text": "A.1 Introduction\nPrior to publishing analysis and interpretation of water quality data, we will ensure that all data that meets QA/QC standards outlined in the current project Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and is accessible in the appropriate repository.\nWater quality data from this project is ultimately destined for the Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Quality Exchange (EPA WQX). The process of transferring these data to the higher-level EPA repository is referred to as data “uplift.”\nThe Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for this project describes data management details and responsible parties for each step of the data pipeline from observation to repository. The 2021 data preparation and review process is published here as an appendix as an example of the process applied annually to each year’s data.\n\nA.1.1 2021 Water Quality Data\nIn this appendix we will collate 2021 laboratory data from several sources into a single spreadsheet document with a consistent format. The desired end format is a spreadsheet template provided by the EPA Water Quality Exchange. These template files are available to download from the EPA at https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/water-quality-exchange-web-template-files.\nOnce the data is collated, it will be evaluated according to a Quality Assurance Checklist (template example provided by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation Soldotna office). Field observations that do not meet the quality assurance standards described in the evaluation checklist will be flagged and will not be uplifted to the EPA WQX.\nData that has been uplifted to the EPA WQX is evaluated biannually by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in their Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report1. The integrated report evaluates available water quality data from the previous five years against Alaska water quality standards and regulations (ADEC 2020).\n\nA.1.1.1 2021 Water Quality Data AQWMS Formatting\nThe code scripts below assemble water quality data from the three analytical laboratories that partnered with Kenai Watershed Forum for this project in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories (Anchorage, AK)\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (Soldotna, AK)\nTaurianen Engineering and Testing (Soldotna, AK)\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.1 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results (SGS Labs)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - Electronic Data Delivery file\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n*Note: the chain of custody documents for SGS Laboratories are integrated into the above downloadable PDF files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.2 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP)/Taurianen Engineering)\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results from SWWTP\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Fecal Coliform Lab Results from Taurianen\n\n\n\n\nDownload Spring 2021 Fecal Coliform Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\nDownload Summer 2021 Fecal Coliform Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.1.1.3 2021 Total Suspended Solids Lab Results (Soldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP))\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP.xlsx\n\n\n\n\nDownload Original Summer 2021 Total Suspended Solids Results from SWWTP.xlsx\n\n\n\n\nDownload Spring 2021 Total Suspended Solids Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\nDownload Summer 2021 Total Suspended Solids Chain of Custody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.2 2021 Provisional Results, Prior to Data Review\nResults last updated 2023-06-23\nThe above data sources have been collated in to a single .csv file (available for download) into a format compatible with the EPA Water Quality Exchange. These data have not yet been evaluated against QA/QC standards following guidance in the current project Quality Assurance Project Plan.\n\n\nDownload All Provisional 2021 Kenai River Baseline Water Quality Monitoring Results, Formatted for EPA WQX uplift\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.3 2021 Data QA/QC Evaluation\nPrior to uplift to the EPA WQX, all water quality data must be checked against a series of standard questions in order to evaluate how quality assurance / quality check (QA/QC) requirements are met. The draft Data Evaluation Checklist Template (available for download below) outlines these questions:\n\n\nDownload Draft Kenai Baseline Data Evaluation Checklist Template\n\n\n\nA.1.3.1 Pre-Database\n\n\nA.1.3.1.1 Overall Project Success\nNote: the sequence of questions is structured such that data will be gradually flagged at each step based on the criteria described.\n\n\n\n1.) Were the appropriate analytical methods used for all parameters?\nYes. Analytical methods from the approved 2020 QAPP were employed.\n\n2.) Were there any deviations from the sampling plan?\nAll sites were visited as planned on 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021. Most intrinsic water quality parameters measured with instruments (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity) were not measured.\n3.) Were field duplicates, blanks, and/or other QC samples collected as planned?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Planned vs. Actual Analysis Results for 2021, Kenai Baseline\n\n\n\nTo see a table comparing planned vs actual results for 2021, view the excel file linked above.\nFrom the above table we can see that there are deviations between planned and actual results available. These reasons for the deviations are known and are attributable to two causes:\nCause 1: The Spring 2021 Chain of Custody (COC) from KWF to SGS was completed erroneously. The COC specified for 200.8 analyses to be complete for all sites (when they should have stopped upstream of Morgan’s Landing RM31), and it also specified for 200.7 analyses to stop upstream of Morgan’s Landing (when they should have been performed for all sites in the project).\nAs a result, for Spring 2021 total metals data will be unavailable for sites upstream of the Morgan’s Landing RM31 site.\nCause 2: For Summer 2021, the SGS performed the 200.8 analyses for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes as requested. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free. In this case., there are no consequences of deviating from the planned analyses).\n\n4.) Do the laboratory reports provide results for all sites and parameters?\nThe laboratory reports provide results for all sites, and for all parameters, with the exceptions outlined above in question #3.\n\n5.) Is a copy of the Chain of Custody included with the laboratory reports?\nWe worked with three separate laboratories in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories, Anchorage, AK\n\nChain of Custody documents are included within the PDF laboratory reports linked above earlier in this appendix.\n\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant, Soldotna, AK\n\nChain of Custody documents are on file with Kenai Watershed Forum for fecal coliform and total suspended solids for 5/11/2021, and for total suspended solids on 7/27/2021.\n\nTauriainen Engineering & Testing, Soldotna, AK\n\nAn individual document for each sample reports the time and date of delivery and analysis for each sample. These documents are included with the PDF laboratory reports linked above earlier in this appendix.\n\n\n\n6.) Do the laboratory reports match the Chain of Custody and requested methods throughout?\nThe laboratory reports match the Chain of Custody and requested methods, with the one exception discussed in question #3. For summer 2021, the SGS performed the 200.8 analyses for all 27 analytes available for the method; instead of just the smaller subset of analytes as requested. (E.g., KWF received extra data for free. In this case., there are no consequences of deviating from the planned analyses).\n\n7.) Are the number of samples on the laboratory reports the same as on the Chain of Custody?\nThe quantity of sample bottles sent to the laboratories matches the number of analyzed samples for samples collected and delivered on 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021.\n\n8.) Was all supporting info provided in the laboratory report, such as reporting limits for all analyses and definitions?\nWe worked with three separate laboratories in 2021:\n\nSGS Laboratories, Anchorage, AK\n\nSGS provided data as PDFs which included reporting limits, as well as in the form of an Electronic Data Deliverable where this information is also included in column format.\n\nSoldotna Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP), Soldotna, AK\n\nSWWTP provided data in the form of .xls files. Reporting limits are described in this project’s current Quality Assurance Action Plan.\n\nTauriainen Engineering & Testing, Soldotna, AK\n\nTauriainen provided data in the form of PDF documents. Reporting limits are described in this project’s current Quality Assurance Action Plan.\n\n\n\n9.) Are site names, dates, and times correct and as expected?\n\nYes, after post-season correction documented in this report. Notes: In 2021 Kenai Watershed Forum used pre-printed waterproof labels on all sample bottles, reducing opportunity for field and lab transcription errors. Remaining site name transcription errors from laboratories were corrected in post-season data review.\n\n\n10.) Were there any issues with instrument calibration?\n\nInstruments to measure intrinsic water quality parameters (sondes; to measure pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity) were not employed in 2021.\nTeams did use hand-held probes to record water temperature on-site. Prior to field use, the hand-held probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level define in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory.\n\n\n11.) Did the instruments perform as expected?\n\nThe hand-held water temperature probes performed as expected in 2021.\n\n\n12.) Was instrument calibration performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\n\nWater temperature is a parameter that is “verified” rather than calibrated. The hand-held water temperature probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level define in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory, according to instrument recommendations.\n\n\n13.) Was instrument verification during the field season performed according to the QAPP and instrument recommendations?\n\nThe hand-held water temperature probes were verified as measuring within the accuracy level define in the QAPP using an ice bath in the laboratory, according to instrument recommendations.\n\n\n14.) Were instrument calibration verification logs or records kept?\n\nYes. These records are held at Kenai Watershed Forum, 44129 Sterling Hwy, Soldotna, AK.\n\n\n15.) Do the instrument data files site IDs, time stamps and file names match?\n\nInstrument files were not employed in 2021. Measurements from hand held probes were recorded on waterproof paper field forms.\n\n\n16.) Is any insitu field data rejected and why?\n\nNo insitu data is rejected from 5/11/2021 or 7/27/2021.\n\n\n17.) Were preservation, hold time and temperature requirements met?\n\nYes. Summer and Spring 2021 holding time requirements were met for all samples. See downloadable files below. Laboratory result documents indicated no compromises of preservation and temperature requirements.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Table of Maximum Holding Times for Each Sample Type\n\n\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(epa_analysis_id)`\n\n\nDownload Holding Time Calculations for Spring and Summer 2021 Field Samples\n\n\n\n18.) Are dissolved metal quantities less than total metals quantities?\n\nDissolved metals results are not consistently less than total metals results, as would be anticipated (see Flowlink website for rationale.)\nIn 2021, there are results available for both dissolved and total metals for three elements: Ca, Fe, and Mg; for sites at and downstream of RM 31.\nDissolved metals results are available for 7/27/2021 (summer) only, and not for 5/11/2021 (spring); see question #3 in this sequence.\nResults:\n\nCalcium: all available observations show dissolved metals > total metals\nIron: all available observations show dissolved metals < total metals\nMagnesium: nearly all available observations show dissolved metals < total metals, with the exception of three sites, all near the Kenai River mouth\n\n\n\n\nDownload 2021 Calcium data, total vs dissolved\n\n\nDownload 2021 Iron data, total vs dissolved\n\n\nDownload 2021 Magnesium data, total vs dissolved\n\n\n\nSee discussion XX in “Summary” section of this report for plans in future years to address the issue of dissolved metals values being greater than total metals values in some cases.\n\n19.) Are the duplicate sample(s) RPD (Relative Percent Difference) within range described in QAPP?\nIn 2021, field duplicate samples were collected at two sites on both 5/11/2021 and 7/27/2021:\n\nNo Name Creek (Tributary, RM0)\nFunny River (Tributary, RM30)\n\nFollowing the example in the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation 2021 Kenai River Metals Field Report (Apsens and Petitt 2022): “… a set of paired samples was evaluated for RPD only if:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were above the [LOQ)]; AND if\nb.) one or both of the samples were at least two times the [LOQ].”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload 2021 Duplicate Sample Data\n\n\nA csv file of RPD values organized by site, date, and parameter may be downloaded below:\n\nFrom the above table, we can see that a limited subset of paired values from field duplicates are eligible to be used for RPD calculations. Pairs of measurements must meet LOQ criteria described above (“a” and “b”). For 2021 data, of 69 paired field duplicate observations, 24 of them may be used for RPD calculations.\nRPD values range from 0 to 165.22.\nIn the 2020 QAPP, RPD values for most parameters are set at 20%, with the exception of “Phosphorus, total” and “Nitrates (NO2+NO3)” at 25%, and “Suspended solids, total” at 5%.\nUsing the available RPD values against the above criteria, four paired observations exceed project precision goals in 2021. Three of these four observations are for fecal coliform, and one is for total phosphorus.\nMost other parameters have at least one available RPD value that is within project precision goals defined in the QAPP. The parameters that do not have at least one RPD calculation available, due to the LOQ constraints described above, include the following:\n\nArsenic\nCadmium\nChromium\nCopper\nLead\nZinc\n\nOther notes: In 2021 the full suite of dissolved metals was run for method 200.8 on samples from 7/27/2021. However we intend to only submit data for parameters that had a pre-defined QA plan as outlined in the QAPP, which is the case for the following dissolved six metals: Mg, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn.\nSummary of Discussion on RPD (Relative percent Difference) Values\nWe attempted to calculate RPD values for all parameters collected in 2021 at two field sites on two dates. For each pair of duplcate observations, one of the following descriptions apply:\n\nIt was possible to calculate RPD values because:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were above the LOQ; AND one or both of the samples were at least two times the LOQ\nProject data will be submitted to EPA WQX if RPD values meet project % goals outlined in the QAPP\n\nIt was not possible to calculate RPD values because:\n\na.) one or both of the samples were not above the LOQ; OR one or both of the samples were not at least two times the LOQ\nProject data will be submitted to EPA WQX if both paired values are non-detect\n\n\nSpecial note on 2021 fecal coliform data Given that 3 out of 4 RPD values for fecal coliform values are >60% (project goal is 20%), field data values for this dataset generally may be suspect.\nTO DO: Calculate RPD values for 2014-2022 and compare, also compare to RPD values in previous comprehensive report.\nBased in this information, we will decide which results to flag and not submit to EPA WQX. Further discussion will be present here in final report, along with a visual flow chart of the logic for when data is excluded and included.\n\n20.) Were there any laboratory discrepancies, errors, data qualifiers, or QC failures (review laboratory duplicates, matrix spikes and blanks)?\nLaboratory discrepancies from the SGS lab are described on page 2 of the spring and summer reports, which are available for download below.\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\nDownload Original Spring 2021 Metals/Nutrients Lab Results from SGS - PDF file\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following discrepancies were identified in the results from SGS laboratories:\nMatrix Spike Recoveries\nA total of 6 matrix spike or matrix spike duplicate samples are outside of QC criteria. The limit of recovery range for the analyte “Total Nitrate/Nitrite-N” is 90% - 110%. For these matrix spike measurements outside of the QC criteria, recovery levels range from 112% - 118%. These values that exceed threshold may be downloaded as a table below:\n\n\nDownload Matrix Spike Recovery Values Exceeding Threshold for Spring and Summer 2021 Sample Analyses\n\n\nNo additional laboratory QA/QC anomalies for any other parameters were noted by any laboratories contracted in 2021. Additional details are available upon request at hydrology@kenaiwatershed.org\nAs of 2023-06-23 we do not intend to reject “Total Nitrate/Nitrite-N” values from the 2021 dataset. The matrix spike recovery fails indicate that reported lab values may be 2% - 7% above actual field values. At a later date we will evaluate these results in the context of year 2000 - present data to help evaluate the validity of this decision, and remove the results from the EPA WQX if appropriate. We would also like to consult with ADEC to determine if these laboratory-identified discrepancies are grounds for rejecting field observations.\n\n21.) Is any laboratory data rejected and why?\nAs of 2023-06-23 we would like to consult with ADEC to determine if these discrepancies discussed in questions #18, #19, and #20 are grounds for rejecting field observations. If so, results will be flagged as appropriate and not submitted to EPA WQX.\n\n22.) During the field season, review raw data files (EDDs [Electronic Data Deliverables], instrument records) as they are received. Document changes and corrections to methods as needed.\nIn 2021, KWF initiated as standard practice the receipt of machine-readable EDD files for contracted laboratories, in addition to PDF results. The EDD files are being reviewed as part of this QA/QC process, which was initiated in Winter 2022.\n\n23.) Is the dataset complete and did you receive the expected number of results?\nFrom the discussion and results in question #3, deviations are evident between planned and actual results reported. The reasons for the deviations are known and are attributable to the two factors discussed in question #3.\n\n24.) Was the data collected representative of environmental conditions?.\nThe data collected in this project is representative of seasonal hydrological conditions on the fieldwork days. Conditions vary instantaneously thus this dataset serves to provide representative snapshots of the watershed across space on two dates.\n\nWork in progress here as of 2023-06-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADEC. 2020. “18 AAC 70 Water Quality Standards.” https://dec.alaska.gov/media/1046/18-aac-70.pdf.\n\n\nApsens, S, and J Petitt. 2022. “Kenai River, Alaska Field Report 2021.”"
