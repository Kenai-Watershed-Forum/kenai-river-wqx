# for unclear reasons,  DUP status in 2021 data is incorrectly assigned to the following:
# KR RM 22 SOC 2021-05-11 200.7
# KR RM 1.5 2021-07-27 200.7
# KR RM 23 2021-05-11 200.7
# KR RM 70 2021-07-27 200.7

# likely explanation -- als ran these as LAB duplicates ... was this even requested or part of the qapp????? yeesh.
# steps:
# 1.) ensure data is transferred from EDD to final export (currently is not, eg. average = "NA", rpd is blank)
# 2.) assign these data as LAB replicates. wtf.

----> not sure if the above is incorporated in flow yet 3/29/2022

Interpretation:
in sgs, FIELD dups are labeled "PS" (project sample) is sample_type
in als, LAB dups are labeled "DUP1" in sample_type

so::: if its a FIELD dup then this info in conatined in sample name only, not in a distinct column (---> From wwhich lab does this apply???)

Distinguish between application in columns
1.)"sample_condition" (Field Duplicate, Trip Blank, NA) vs.
2.) "sample_type" (PS, TB, SMPL)

3.) I think I have addressed this; will find out in export file

In general for future drafts of QA/QC procedure: write intake/processing scripts in .R files and source them in to the Quarto file. Will make easier in long term to apply standard across multiple documents.
