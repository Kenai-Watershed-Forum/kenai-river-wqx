# Regulatory Limits

We calculated regulatory limits based on freshwater quality standards listed from state and federal regulatory agencies.

##Hardness

Some regulatory values are hardness-dependent, and hardness varies by site, by season, and with hydrologic conditions. We calculated hardness according to the following formula:

Hardness = 2.497(Total Calcium in mg/L) + 4.119(Total Magnesium in mg/L)

For sampling events with duplicate samples, we calculated average hardness

```{r echo = F}
library(tidyverse)

# calculate hardness for all sample events in project history

# source formatted data
dat <- read.csv("other/output/analysis_format/baseline_analysis_format.csv")

# calculate hardness column
hd <- dat %>%
  select(activity_identifier, activity_start_date, characteristic_name, result_measure_value) %>%
  filter(characteristic_name %in% (c("Magnesium","Calcium"))) %>%
  group_by(activity_identifier, activity_start_date, characteristic_name) %>%
  # get mean of duplicate samples
  summarise(avg_value = mean(result_measure_value)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "characteristic_name", values_from = "avg_value") %>%
  mutate(hardness = 2.497*(Calcium) + 4.119*(Magnesium)) %>%
  select(-Calcium, -Magnesium)

# join hardness back to overall dataset
z <- left_join(dat,hd)

# need to distinguish dup samples
# this export does not seem to include the distinction?!

# going back to appendix a to remedy

# it appears that export from EPA WQX of 2000 - 2014 data does not include status of samples as DUP or Trip Blank. Are results included at all? Also not that from Summer 2022 - present we are also using field blanks

# 11/16/23 working here to set up formulas for calculated criteria, see spreadsheet other/input/regulatory_limits

# 1.) read in static reg values
# 2.) calculate acute values
# 3.) calculate chronic values
# 4.) calculate other condition-dependent values (e.g. temp)
