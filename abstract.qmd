# Abstract {.unnumbered}

The Kenai Watershed Forum and governmental agencies formed a cooperative partnership to collect and analyze synoptic water samples from 13 locations along the Kenai River mainstem and from eight of its tributaries every spring and summer from 2000 to present day. Laboratory quantification was conducted on dissolved metals, total metals, nutrients, hydrocarbons, fecal coliform bacteria, and several other parameters. We also collected and assessed in-situ parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, turbidity, and conductivity. These results are herein compared to Alaska and federal water quality standards for freshwater aquatic life.
