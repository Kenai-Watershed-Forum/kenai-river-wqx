## Interpreting Box Plots

Each of the following graphs display the sampling results for a specific parameter, such as arsenic. Within these graphs, a box and extending lines represent the results reported at each sampling site. A horizontal line within the box corresponds to the median of the data. The box contains 50% of the data and the vertical lines display the minimum and maximum values. All data points generating the boxplot are superimposed atop it (@fig-boxplot1).
