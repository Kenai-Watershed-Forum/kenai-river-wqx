Updated the source with corrected 2021 data from wqx, but boxplot figures still not displaying 2021 data in some cases. also, Ca, Mg 2021
data clearly have wring units. need to remov elegend where not applicable also

# 2/25/25
Sent email to help desk at EPA for assistance on updating/deleting 2021 data. today, just workingon getting 
the update version prepped.

# 2/14/2025
working at line 340 in reg_limits. make sure 2021 hydrocarbon data format aligns with 2000 - 2013.
2021 epq wqx did not include hydrocarbons? diagnose in appendix a
--> appears that final export prep to epa cdx does include hydrocarbons. are they in the download???
--> diagnosis: hydrocarbons were in the upload to epa wqx in jan 2024, but are not present in the download in jan 2025
--> plan: delete all 2021 data from epa wqx, make corrections as outlined in gdoc, re-upload all 2021 data to epa cdx.
--> then, repeat ingestion process to this report
--> gdoc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p1fsh2dVfvIWNmRrpjteOTyLPSEeMYoQDRk5XhKTcNk/edit?tab=t.0


also: get rid of extraneous legend data where hardness does not apply




# 2/6/2025
working at line 123 in reg_limits.qmd.
here we discover that hardness values do not properly calculate with addition of 2021 data.
to do: 1) address calculation of hardness values; adress units/conversion for some summer 
2021 values that are out of realisic range


ex: summer 2021 no name creek dups, diss Ca = 16200 and 16300 ug/L, total Ca dups = 13.7 and 1.8 mg/L dups


# 2/3/2025
1) try a new fresh download from EPA WQX, ensure it has the 2021 data and it can be read in/integrated with the report document
2) proceed with years in this doc, going 2021 backwards

see to do list in data_sourcing.qmd doc

working in reg_limits.qmd, see hastags.
put new wqp downloads in kwf work cpu also
note: data_sourcing a mess at the moment
